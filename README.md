# Supercell Coding Challenge 2024

This is a small game made for the Supercell Coding Challenge 2024.
It’s written in C++ and uses the SFML library.

Black Cat Sanctuary
The idea of the game is to save as many black cats as possible. You’ll be a witch, flying on a broom and you need to gather more cats while avoiding obstacles, using spells to defeat enemies and solving puzzles. Any hit by an obstacle or an enemy makes you lose a cat as well as any wrong press during puzzle mode. If you lose all your cats, the game will end.

Move up & down: W / S
Use a spell: Spacebar
Puzzle choices: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
